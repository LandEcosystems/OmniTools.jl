- `Optim`: Supplies optimization algorithms such as BFGS and LBFGS for gradient-based optimization.
- `Optimization`: A unified interface for various optimization backends, simplifying the integration of multiple libraries.
- `OptimizationOptimJL`: Integrates the `Optim` library into the `Optimization` interface.
- `OptimizationBBO`: Provides black-box optimization methods for derivative-free optimization.
- `OptimizationGCMAES`: Implements the GCMA-ES (Global Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) algorithm.
- `OptimizationCMAEvolutionStrategy`: Integrates CMA-ES into the `Optimization` interface.
- `QuasiMonteCarlo`: Provides quasi-Monte Carlo methods for optimization, useful for high-dimensional problems.
- `StableRNGs`: Supplies stable random number generators for reproducible optimization results.
- `GlobalSensitivity`: Provides tools for global sensitivity analysis, including Sobol indices and variance-based sensitivity analysis.
- `Sindbad`: Provides the core SINDBAD models and types.
- `SindbadUtils`: Provides utility functions for handling NamedTuple, spatial operations, and other helper tasks for spatial and temporal operations.
- `SindbadSetup`: Provides the SINDBAD setup.
- `SindbadTEM`: Provides the SINDBAD Terrestrial Ecosystem Model (TEM) as the target for optimization tasks.
- `SindbadMetrics`: Supplies metrics for evaluating model performance, which are used in cost function calculations.
