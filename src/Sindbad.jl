    Sindbad

A Julia package for the terrestrial ecosystem models within **S**trategies to **IN**tegrate **D**ata and **B**iogeochemic**A**l mo**D**els `(SINDBAD)` framework.

The `Sindbad` package serves as the core of the SINDBAD framework, providing foundational types, utilities, and tools for building and managing SINDBAD models.

# Purpose:
This package defines the `LandEcosystem` supertype, which serves as the base for all SINDBAD models. It also provides utilities for managing model variables, tools for model operations, and a catalog of variables used in SINDBAD workflows.

# Dependencies:
- `Reexport`: Simplifies re-exporting functionality from other packages, ensuring a clean and modular design.
- `CodeTracking`: Enables tracking of code definitions, useful for debugging and development workflows.
- `DataStructures`: Provides advanced data structures (e.g., `OrderedDict`, `Deque`) for efficient data handling in SINDBAD models.
- `Dates`: Handles date and time operations, useful for managing temporal data in SINDBAD experiments.
- `Flatten`: Supplies tools for flattening nested data structures, simplifying the handling of hierarchical model variables.
- `InteractiveUtils`: Enables interactive exploration and debugging during development.
- `Parameters`: Provides macros for defining and managing model parameters in a concise and readable manner.
- `StaticArraysCore`: Supports efficient, fixed-size arrays (e.g., `SVector`, `MArray`) for performance-critical operations in SINDBAD models.
- `TypedTables`: Provides lightweight, type-stable tables for structured data manipulation.
- `Accessors`: Enables efficient access and modification of nested data structures, simplifying the handling of SINDBAD configurations.
- `StatsBase`: Supplies statistical functions such as `mean`, `percentile`, `cor`, and `corspearman` for computing metrics like correlation and distribution-based statistics.
- `NaNStatistics`: Extends statistical operations to handle missing values (`NaN`), ensuring robust data analysis.


# Included Files:
1. **`coreTypes.jl`**:
   - Defines the core types used in SINDBAD, including the `LandEcosystem` supertype and other fundamental types.

2. **`utilsCore.jl`**:
   - Contains core utility functions for SINDBAD, including helper methods for array operations and code generation macros for NamedTuple packing and unpacking.

3. **`sindbadVariableCatalog.jl`**:
   - Defines a catalog of variables used in SINDBAD models, ensuring consistency and standardization across workflows. Note that every new variable would need a manual entry in the catalog so that the output files are written with correct information.

4. **`modelTools.jl`**:
   - Provides tools for extracting information from SINDBAD models, including mode code, variables, and parameters.

5. **`Models/models.jl`**:
   - Implements the core SINDBAD models, inheriting from the `LandEcosystem` supertype. Also, introduces the fallback function for compute, precompute, etc. so that they are optional in every model.

6. **`generateCode.jl`**:
   - Contains code generation utilities for SINDBAD models and workflows.

# Notes:
- The `LandEcosystem` supertype serves as the foundation for all SINDBAD models, enabling extensibility and modularity.
- The package re-exports key functionality from other packages (e.g., `Flatten`, `StaticArraysCore`, `DataStructures`) to simplify usage and integration.
- Designed to be lightweight and modular, allowing seamless integration with other SINDBAD packages.

# Examples:
1. **Defining a new SINDBAD model**:
```julia
struct MyModel <: LandEcosystem
    # Define model-specific fields
end
```

2. **Using utilities from the package**:
```julia
using Sindbad
# Access utilities or models
flattened_data = flatten(nested_data)
```

3. **Querying the variable catalog**:
```julia
using Sindbad
catalog = getVariableCatalog()
```

   LandEcosystem

   $(purpose(LandEcosystem))

   # Methods
   All subtypes of `LandEcosystem` must implement at least one of the following methods:
   - `define`: Initialize arrays and variables
   - `precompute`: Update variables with new realizations
   - `compute`: Update model state in time
   - `update`: Update pools within a single time step


   # Example
   ```julia
   # Define a new model type
   struct MyModel <: LandEcosystem end

   # Implement required methods
   function define(params::MyModel, forcing, land, helpers)
   # Initialize arrays and variables
   return land
   end

   function precompute(params::MyModel, forcing, land, helpers)
   # Update variables with new realizations
   return land
   end

   function compute(params::MyModel, forcing, land, helpers)
   # Update model state in time
   return land
   end

   function update(params::MyModel, forcing, land, helpers)
   # Update pools within a single time step
   return land
   end
   ```
